In this page, we have high-level KPIs that the leadership team cares about: revenue, profit, order, and return rate. We've got a nicely revenue trending chart here as well. We use some Intractive elements that Power Bi offers like sliders to zoom in one specific time periods, custom tool tips. We can drill into any specific product to take us to our product detail view.
